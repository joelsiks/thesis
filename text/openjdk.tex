OpenJDK~\cite{openjdk} is a set of tools for creating and running Java programs, maintained by Oracle. HotSpot~\cite{hotspot} is one of these tools and the reference implementation of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)~\cite{JVM}. Specifically, a virtual machine (VM) emulates a distinct computer in order to run various programs, which could be anything from full operating systems - to more specialized machines. Hence, the JVM is designed specifically to execute Java programs. It translates programs to instructions for the underlying machine, creating an abstraction of the hardware of the physical machine and allows Java programs to be run on any platform that the JVM runs on.

HotSpot is compromised of several components for running Java applications, such as an interpreter, a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler, and a garbage collector (GC). In combination, these components provide the means for running different types of Java programs on the platforms supported by HotSpot.
