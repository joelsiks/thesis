\subsection{Performance}
\label{sec:results:performance}

The result of the single allocation benchmark is presented in Figure~\ref{fig:allocation_performance}. Initializing the memory after allocating is observed to have minimal impact on performance immediately following an allocation request. Performing the absolute worst-case allocation, when only a larger block exists, is shown to be slower in all cases than when a suitable block exists. This is expected since more work is done than when a suitable block exists. Furthermore, the optimized version is on par with the performance of the reference version, while the general version is slower than the other two versions.

\end{figure}

In contrast, the benchmark result of performing a single free is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:free_performance}. The general and optimized versions are observed to be comparable and are both about 25\% slower than the reference version. It is worth noting that both the reference and general version have coalescing disabled, which has an impact on performance and should be taken into account when considering the results.

    \label{fig:free_performance}
\end{figure}

The relative performance results when applying patterns of allocations and frees are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:program_benchmarks}, and absolute values in Table~\ref{table:program_benchmarks}. The reference version is observed to be about 12\% faster in average than the other two versions across all programs, while the general and optimized versions are on-par in most programs, with slight deviations. There is an overhead of logistically applying the allocations and frees, which is added to all programs. As such, the results include this overhead.

\end{table}

The ratio between allocations and frees for the patterns are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:program_ratios}, which also includes the ratio of free calls made with NULL as argument, i.e \texttt{free(nullptr)}. The reason this is highlighted is since \texttt{free(nullptr)} returns immediately without doing anything, which is a valid operation according to the \texttt{malloc()} API.

\subsection{Internal Fragmentation}

The size of the block header for the different versions are: 32 bytes, of which 16 bytes can be used by allocated blocks for the reference version; 32 bytes for the general version; and 0 bytes for the optimized version. 

In the worst case with maximum padding necessary, the reference version will waste up to 57.5\%, general version 69.6\% and the optimized version 29.2\%, if filling the heap with as many allocations as possible of 17 bytes. Looking at the second case where there is no padding necessary for alignment, the reference version will waste up to 50\%, general version 66\% and the optimized version 0\%, if filling the heap with as many allocations as possible of 16 bytes.

To summarize, when filling the heap with as small allocations as possible and considering the size of the block header and any necessary padding due to alignment, the reference version will waste 50\%-57.5\%, general version 66\%-69.6\% and the optimized version 0\%-29.2\%, depending on the amount of padding that is applied. This means that for the optimized version, the single source of internal fragmentation is due to the padding that is applied.

% Worst case for reference is when the blockheader + alignment is maximum.

% Assumptions:
%  - 2MB heap, largest allocation is 256KB, smallest is 16B, alignment is 8B

% Three cases, fill the heap with allocations of same size:
% Case 1 (worst case for reference):
%  - 17B
% Case 2 (no alignment padding, only block header overhead)
%  - 16B

% Case 3 (worst case for optimized version, maximum alignment)
%  - 17B
% Note: Best case for optimized is any multiple of MBS (16B), Case 2 shows this.
