
ZGC is a garbage collector available in the OpenJDK. It was introduced as an experimental implementation in OpenJDK 11, but was declared production ready in OpenJDK 15. ZGC is modern, generational, region-based, parallel garbage collector that aims to keep pauses at a constant time even though the heap size increases. This means latency will remain low as the heap size increases.%~\cite{zgc:deepdive}.
