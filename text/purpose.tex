The purpose of this work is to explore, implement, and evaluate adaptations to the free-list-based Two-Level Segregated Fit (TLSF) memory allocator for use in ZGC. The findings will help facilitate a transition from bump-pointer allocation to free-list-based allocation to improve the speed and memory efficiency of ZGC. Although quantitative metrics will be used to evaluate the findings, this work will mainly be about the adaptations that are made and what challenges and opportunities present themselves.

Specifically, the research questions this work seeks to answer are:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What constraints need to be considered when adapting an allocator for ZGC?
    \item How can the constraints of ZGC be utilized to optimize the performance and memory efficiency of the allocator?
\end{enumerate}
