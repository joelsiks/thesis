The purpose of this work is to explore, implement and evaluate possible adaptations to an existing free-list-based allocator for use in ZGC. The findings will help facilitate a transition from bump-pointer allocation to free-list-based allocation, to improve the speed and memory efficiency of ZGC. Although quantitative metrics will be used to evaluate our findings, this work will mainly be about the adaptations that are done and what challenges and opportunities present themselves.

Specifically, the research questions we seek to answer are:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What boundaries are there to consider when adapting an allocator for ZGC?
    \item How can the boundaries of ZGC be used to optimize performance and memory efficiency of the allocator?
\end{enumerate}
