The main limitation of this project is that we will not be integrating the allocator into ZGC and OpenJDK. A scope of 20 weeks is deemed not enough to implement, adapt, evaluate and also integrate an allocator.

Additionally, we will focus on adapting the allocator to be used for small and medium pages in ZGC exclusively. Large pages will not be considered in this work.
