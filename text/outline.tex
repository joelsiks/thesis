Sections~\ref{sec:background} and~\ref{sec:tlsf} provide essential background information on the concepts of memory allocation, allocators, and garbage collection techniques. Section~\ref{sec:related-work} presents related work and approaches to using allocators and free-lists. Section~\ref{sec:method} details the methodology followed in this work. Sections~\ref{sec:adaptations} and~\ref{sec:adaptations-impl} introduce and elaborate on specific allocator adaptations. Section~\ref{sec:evaluation} describes the methodology used to evaluate the performance of the adapted allocator. Section~\ref{sec:results} reports the results of the evaluation, which are then discussed along with the implications of the adaptations in Section~\ref{sec:discussion}. Finally, Section~\ref{sec:future-work} outlines potential directions for future work, and Section~\ref{sec:conclusions} concludes the thesis.
