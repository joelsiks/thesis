Sections~\ref{sec:background} and~\ref{sec:tlsf} covers the area of memory allocation, allocators and garbage collection relevant to this work. Section~\ref{sec:related-work} gives an introduction to related work. Sections~\ref{sec:adaptations} and~\ref{sec:adaptations-impl} reasons about and introduces allocator adaptations. Section~\ref{sec:evaluation} continues with how the adapted allocator is evaluated and compared in a fair environment. Section~\ref{sec:results} details the evaluation results, which are then discussed in combination with the implications of the adaptations in Section~\ref{sec:discussion}. Finally, Section~\ref{sec:future-work} presents future work and Section~\ref{sec:conclusions} concludes.
