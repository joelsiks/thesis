Memory management is a crucial aspect of modern software development, particularly in Java applications where dynamic memory allocation and garbage collection play a central role. Java automatically manages memory through garbage collection, which allocates and frees memory without programmer intervention, facilitating more productive and robust software development. However, realizing this convenience efficiently can be challenging, particularly in terms of performance and scalability.

In the Open Java Development Kit (OpenJDK), the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) provides a set of garbage collectors, one of which is the Z Garbage Collector (ZGC). ZGC divides the available memory into pages that can be operated on concurrently. Memory is allocated sequentially on a per-page basis using a method called bump-pointer allocation, which tracks a position where allocations are made and moves it with each new allocation. A notable downside of bump-pointer allocation is its inability to allocate memory anywhere within a page, making it difficult to reuse previously allocated memory without relocating all live objects to another page.

This inherent inflexibility of bump-pointer allocation may contribute to increased intra-page fragmentation, as objects are allocated strictly at the top of available memory, potentially leaving unused space within the page. An alternative method is to use a free-list to keep track of where memory can be allocated on a per-page level. Allocating memory using a free-list can potentially distribute objects more efficiently throughout the page, thereby reducing fragmentation and maximizing memory utilization.

The advantage of a free-list is that it easily tracks fragmented memory and facilitates object allocation within such memory. There are instances where free-lists have been used in the context of garbage collection to allocate memory. For example, the well-established mark-sweep algorithm does not compact memory and thus uses a free-list to manage the fragmentation that results from this approach. Research on the implementation of free-list-based memory allocators with sophisticated garbage collection algorithms, such as ZGC, is currently limited. This project aims to explore potential challenges and opportunities in this area and to determine how memory allocation using free-lists can be optimized.
