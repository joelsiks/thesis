The primary author and principal contributor to this thesis is Joel Sikström. Joel independently developed all sections, except for Section~\ref{sec:background}, which was collaboratively authored with Niclas Gärds and Casper Norrbin. Both Niclas and Casper pursued their own theses in parallel with this one, with Casper focusing on adapting a Buddy Allocator and Niclas on integrating an allocator into ZGC. Casper's work resulted in distinct adaptations and outcomes, while Niclas explored the challenges and opportunities of integrating an allocator into ZGC, a natural extension of both this and Casper's research.

For the section developed in collaboration with Niclas and Casper, the contributions are as follows: Sections~\ref{sec:memory_management},~\ref{sec:fragmentation} and~\ref{sec:memory_allocation} are authored solely by Joel, Sections~\ref{sec:hotspot} and~\ref{sec:gc} are solely authored by Casper, and Section~\ref{sec:zgc} is authored solely by Niclas.
