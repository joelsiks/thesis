The Java programming language manages memory automatically through the use of a garbage collector. One such collector is ZGC, which allocates memory inside regions using a method called bump-pointer allocation, which suffers from fragmentation. To address this challenge, ZGC employs memory relocation techniques to cleverly move memory to reduce fragmentation, which is not always possible nor cheap to do. This thesis proposes to use an alternative memory allocation method leveraging free-lists to efficiently manage and allocate into fragmented memory.\\

Drawing inspiration from the TLSF memory allocator, this thesis presents an optimized version tailored for ZGC. Through exploration of ZGC's operational boundaries, opportunities for enhancements in performance and memory efficiency are identified. While time constraints prevent direct integration into ZGC, a comparative evaluation against a reference implementation is conducted. Results show that the optimized allocator performs on-par with the reference design for single allocations, and is slightly slower for single frees and applying allocation patterns from real-world programs. The largest adaptation is the introduction of the 0-byte header, leveraging overlapping information in the garbage collector to minimize internal fragmentation to levels identical to bump-pointer allocation.\\
