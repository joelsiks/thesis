As previously mentioned, garbage collection is a method of achieving automatic memory management where the system identifies and cleans up unused objects, which are considered garbage. This removes the requirement of managing memory from the user, which reduces the possibility of memory related issues occurring. This also removes some control from the user, and could lead to sub-optimal usage of system memory.
